# Project description
#### Sending or receiving packages can be a hassle in today's fast-paced world. With just a few taps on your smartphone, you can send or receive packages on time and with complete transparency. Originally, this was a two-week student project made by Wai Ian Vong, Micaela Frigola, Mayavi Steiner and Corinna Grundmeier. Link [here](http://github.com/valenvwi/QuickDrop).
#### I have added additional pages to complete the driver's journey, edited validations for orders and add-ons to improve user's journey. 

#### This app is designed for mobile. To ensure the best experience, please use a mobile device to access. :iphone:

## Functionality

#### As a customer... :package:
1. I can enter the pick-up address, drop-off address and pick-up time in order to calculate the arrival time
2. I can add names and contact information to ensure the pick-up works well
3. I can specify details about the delivered item (size, fragile) in order to ensure a safe delivery
4. I can see the estimated duration of the delivery and price information before submitting the order
5. I can see the delivery status, and cancel the delivery
6. I can check my order history

#### As a driver... :motor_scooter:
1. I can see the submitted orders
2. I can accept or decline the orders (jobs) to better plan my trips
3. I can mark the job as completed and see how much I have earned for that single job
4. I can check my ongoing jobs, and my job history
