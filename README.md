# Project description
#### Sending or receiving packages can be a hassle in today's fast-paced world. With just a few taps on your smartphone, you can send or receive packages on time and with complete transparency. Originally, this is a student two-week project made by Wai Ian Vong, Micaela Frigola, Mayavi Steiner and Corinna Grundmeier. Link [here](http://github.com/valenvwi/QuickDrop).
#### I have added additional pages to complete the driver's journey, edited validations for orders and add ons to improvise user's journey. 

#### Here is the link on Heroku, below is a guide to read before you start.

#### As a user...
##### 1. I can enter the pick-up address, drop-off address and pick-up time in order to calculate the arrival time
##### 2. I can add names and contact information to ensure the pick-up works well
##### 3. I can specify details about the delivered item (size, fragile) in order to ensure a safer delivery
##### 4. I can see the estimated duration of the delivery and price information before submitting the order
##### 5. I can see the status of delivery, and cancel the delivery
##### 6. I can check my order history

#### As a driver...
##### 1. I can see the submitted orders
##### 2. I can accept of decline the orders(jobs) to be better to plan my trips
##### 3. I can make the job as completed and see how much I have earned for that single job
##### 4. I can check my ongoing jobs, and my job history
